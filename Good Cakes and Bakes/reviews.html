        <h2>Remarks from a few of our incredible customers!</h2>

        <div class="flex-container">

            <div> I recently found out about this from someone's recommendations, 
            and I'm quite happy I did. They make pretty good brownies. 
            Their Nutella Brownies are my favorite item on the menu. 
            What gives these brownies their delicious flavor is their very sweet and chocolatey hazelnut flavor.
            I'll make certain to return.! <br><br> ~ Eiva</div>

            <div>You must give Good Cakes And Bakes a try! 
                They offer a ton of alternatives and a wide variety of sweets that seem like typical desserts,
                but they touch a distinct note, I promise. The inside decor is wonderful as well! Without a doubt, 
                you need to look them up! <br><br> ~ Sara </div>


            <div>The shop deserves to be tried by everybody! I recently tried it as it opened up close to my house,
            and since I like sweets, I can honestly say that everything on their menu is delicious.
            My mother, sisters, and friends were all happy that I had introduced them to this adorable bakery.
            I wholeheartedly recommend!  <br><br> ~ Tasmin </div>
